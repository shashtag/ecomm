I can’t remember\n            which day it was but somewhere in August end or early September,\n            Mithil called me at around 1 AM and said he had an idea to talk, and\n            that’s actually when Kalafex came into existence. At that point the\n            idea was just extremely rough and still needed a lot of planning so\n            immediately we hopped onto brainstorming to make the business model\n            sustainable for us. The both of us are still in school but since it\n            was online classes we had more time on our hands than ever.\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography variant='h5' className={classes.para}>\n            I’ve seen the struggle of individual sellers on social media\n            platforms and how they aren’t getting the outreach and recognition\n            that they deserve. The algorithm on major platforms doesn’t exactly\n            prevent but it makes it harder for small content creators to be\n            noticed. I have a few friends of mine whose artwork is absolutely\n            mesmerising but they could never get the amount of recognition that\n            they deserved. Kalafex was an opportunity to bring upon a change on\n            this very issue in question. By providing a proper platform to sell\n            their products without any direct fees or hidden fees, the artists\n            are able to use our website hassle-free and by providing them\n            logistics services alongside other services, we are able to create a\n            community of artists all around India. Currently, we’ve made\n            Kalafex’s services available in almost all parts of India. We plan\n            to promote the self-reliant India movement of Atmanirbhar Bharat and\n            in my personal opinion, the Indian youth would benefit a lot from us\n            by starting a business at a young age.{\" \"}\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography variant='h5' className={classes.para}>\n            As a teenage entrepreneur, I’ve always learnt to listen to what\n            people have to say but never take it to my heart. The best advice I\n            have ever received is to ‘never take criticism from someone you\n            would not take advice from’. Which I feel like is extremely\n            important when starting a business. I had people tell me that this\n            start-up idea would not work because it lacked certain fragments of\n            realistic business values due to which no one would want to join the\n            website and as Mithil and I progressed further and further the\n            thoughts of Kalafex not working out hit me harder but I kept my head\n            up and focussed on making it work. Today, Kalafex has become a\n            reality and I’m proud of us.\n          </Typography>\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n      <Grid container item className={classes.section}>\n        <Grid>\n          <Typography variant='h4' className={classes.name}>\n            Mithil Anup\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography variant='h5' className={classes.title}>\n            Co-Founder & Senior Managing Director (S-MD)\n          </Typography>\n          <Typography variant='h5' className={classes.para}>\n            Aryan is lying, HELP ME\n          </Typography>\n        </Grid>\n      </Grid>\n    </Grid>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default AboutUs;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
