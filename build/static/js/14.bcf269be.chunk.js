I have a few friends of mine whose artwork is absolutely mesmerising but they could never get the amount of recognition that they deserved. Kalafex was an opportunity to bring upon a change on this very issue in question. By providing a proper platform to sell their products without any direct fees or hidden fees, the artists are able to use our website hassle-free and by providing them logistics services alongside other services, we are able to create a community of artists all around India. Currently, we\u2019ve made Kalafex\u2019s services available in almost all parts of India.

I had people tell me that this start-up idea would not work because it lacked certain fragments of realistic business values due to which no one would want to join the website and as Mithil and I progressed further and further the thoughts of Kalafex not working out hit me harder but I kept my head up and focussed on making it work.
